## Public Key Cryptography with the RSA Algorithm

RSA is the most widely used public key cryptography algorithm. It solves the problem of establishing a secure connection over an insecure network (i.e. the internet) while ensuring confidentiality and authenticity of communications.

The beauty of this algorithm is that you can share a public key with everyone, and it won’t compromise confidentiality because decryption requires a “private key” that is essentially the output of the RSA algorithm. This private key can only be derived “privately” from both endpoints using the RSA algorithm.

This algorithm is instrumental to the modern civilization because it solved the problem of secret key distribution. Indeed, before RSA’s advent one had to find a secure way to share the “secret key” with message recipients. The same key that was used to encrypt messages was also used to decrypt them (symmetrical encryption). RSA made asymmetric encryption possible by providing the algorithm necessary to exchange keys in public without affecting the security of the encryption scheme.


## An example of asymmetric cryptography :

>> A client (for example browser) sends its public key to the server and requests for some data.
>> The server encrypts the data using client’s public key and sends the encrypted data.
>> Client receives this data and decrypts it.
>> Since this is asymmetric, nobody else except browser can decrypt the data even if a third party has public key of browser.


>>The idea of RSA is based on the fact that it is difficult to factorize a large integer. The public key consists of two numbers where one number is multiplication of two large prime numbers. And private key is also derived from the same two prime numbers. So if somebody can factorize the large number, the private key is compromised. Therefore encryption strength totally lies on the key size and if we double or triple the key size, the strength of encryption increases exponentially. RSA keys can be typically 1024 or 2048 bits long, but experts believe that 1024 bit keys could be broken in the near future. But till now it seems to be an infeasible task.


## Let us learn the mechanism behind RSA algorithm :

# Generating Public Key :
* Select two prime no's. Suppose P = 53 and Q = 59.
  Now First part of the Public key  : n = P*Q = 3127.
* We also need a small exponent say e : 
  But e Must be :-
              * An integer.
              * Not be a factor of n. 
              * 1 < e < Φ(n) [Φ(n) is discussed below], 
                Let us now consider it to be equal to 3.
* Our Public Key is made of n and e

# Generating Private Key :
* We need to calculate Φ(n) :
  Such that Φ(n) = (P-1)(Q-1)     
      so,  Φ(n) = 3016
    
* Now calculate Private Key, d : 
  d = (k*Φ(n) + 1) / e for some integer k
  For k = 2, value of d is 2011.
Now we are ready with our – Public Key ( n = 3127 and e = 3) and Private Key(d = 2011)

Now we will encrypt “HI” :

* Convert letters to numbers : H  = 8 and I = 9
    
* Thus Encrypted Data c = 89e mod n. 
  Thus our Encrypted Data comes out to be 1394

Now we will decrypt 1394 : 
    
* Decrypted Data = cd mod n. 
  Thus our Encrypted Data comes out to be 89
  8 = H and I = 9 i.e. "HI".
